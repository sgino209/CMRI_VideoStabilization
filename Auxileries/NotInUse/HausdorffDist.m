function [hd D] = HausdorffDist(P,Q,lmf)
% Calculates the Hausdorff Distance between P and Q
%
% hd = HausdorffDist(P,Q)
% [hd D] = HausdorffDist(P,Q)
% [hd D] = HausdorffDist(...,lmf)
%
% Calculates the Hausdorff Distance, hd, between two sets of points, P and
% Q (which could be two trajectories). Sets P and Q must be matricies with
% an equal number of columns (dimensions), though not necessarily an equal
% number of rows (observations).
%
% The Directional Hausdorff Distance (dhd) is defined as:
% dhd(P,Q) = max p c P [ min q c Q [ ||p-q|| ] ].
% Intuitively dhd finds the point p from the set P that is farthest from
% any point in Q and measures the distance from p to its nearest neighbor
% in Q.
% 
% The Hausdorff Distance is defined as max{dhd(P,Q),dhd(Q,P)}
%
% D is the matrix of distances where D(n,m) is the distance of the nth
% point in P from the mth point in Q.
%
% Note: If the size of P and Q are very large, the matrix of distances
% between them, D, will be too large to store in memory. Therefore, the
% function will check your available memory and not build the D matrix if
% it will exceed your available memory and instead use a faster version of
% the code. If this occurs, D will be returned as the empty matrix. You may
% force the code to forgo the D matrix even for small P and Q by calling the
% function with the optional 3rd lmf variable set to 1. You may also force
% the function to return the D matrix by setting lmf to 0.
%
% Performance Note: Including the lmf input increases the speed of the
% algorithm by avoiding the overhead associated with checking memory
% availability. For the lmf=0 case, this may represent a sizeable
% percentage of the entire run-time.

% %%% ZCD Oct 2009 %%%
% Edits ZCD: Added the matrix of distances as an output. Fixed bug that
%   would cause an error if one of the sets was a single point. Removed
%   excess calls to "size" and "length". - May 2010
% Edits ZCD: Allowed for comparisons of N-dimensions. - June 2010
% Edits ZCD: Added large matrix mode to avoid insufficient memory errors
%   and a user input to control this mode. - April 2012
% Edits ZCD: Using bsxfun rather than repmat in large matrix mode to
%   increase performance speeds. [update recommended by Roel H on MFX] -
%   October 2012.
